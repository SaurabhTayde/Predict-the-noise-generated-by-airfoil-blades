# Predict-the-noise-generated-by-airfoil-blades
 The noise generated by an aircraft is an efficient and environmental matter for the aerospace industry. A vital component of the total airframe noise is the airfoil self-noise, which is due to the interaction between an airfoil blade and the turbulence produced in its boundary layer and near wake. The data is fetched from UCI repository. The dataset is made up of 1,503 samples (xi), with five parameters describing the wind tunnel configuration and a dependent variable (yi) that represents the scaled sound pressure (in dB). So, Goal of this project is to predict sound pressure level and The variable to be predicted is continuous (sound pressure level).
